# GraduationProjectsPortfolio
This project provides a dynamic and elegant way to display university graduation projects using **Google Drive** for storage and **Google Apps Script** for the backend. The frontend is an HTML file that integrates Bootstrap for responsive design, and the entire application can be embedded into a webpage via an iframe or can be redirected.

## Key Features:
- **Organized by Academic Year**: Projects are grouped by academic year, with easy navigation to select and view each yearâ€™s projects.
- **Dynamic Project Display**: Each project can have a poster (PDF or image) and a video, displayed with a sleek interface.
- **Google Drive Integration**: Projects (posters and videos) are stored in Google Drive, and the app fetches them dynamically.
- **Infinite Scroll**: As users scroll, more projects are loaded automatically, providing a smooth browsing experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap, the interface adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Modal Previews**: Users can preview project posters and videos directly within the app using modal windows.
  
This project is ideal for showcasing student work, academic portfolios, or any collection of multimedia projects. It is designed to be embedded easily into any university website or portfolio page.

## Technologies Used:
- **Google Apps Script**: Backend logic to fetch project data from Google Drive.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend for displaying project information.
