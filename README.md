# GraduationProjectsPortfolio
This project provides a dynamic and elegant way to display university graduation projects using **Google Drive** for storage and **Google Apps Script** for the backend. The frontend is an HTML file that integrates Bootstrap for responsive design, and the entire application can be embedded into a webpage via an iframe or can be redirected.
